Graphunin = (collectd + Graphite) - Munin
===================================

Graphunin is a simple javascript based dashboard application that mimics the per host dashboard layout that Munin is known for.

# Configuration

Almost all configuration (Graphite server location, metric base, etc) is location in `graphunin.js`

# Installing / Running

Clone this repo locally or onto a webserver.  Modify appropriate configuration files.  Point your browser at graphunin.html and start using.

# Collectd configuration

This is an example of the write_graphite configuration that Graphunin is currently configured to work with:

````
<Plugin write_graphite>
  <Carbon>
    Host "graphiteHost.domain"
    Port "2003"
    Prefix "servers."
    Postfix ""
    EscapeCharacter "_"
    StoreRates true
    SeparateInstances true
    AlwaysAppendDS false
  </Carbon>
</Plugin>
````

GenericJMX plugin notes:

Graphunin will leverage collectd's ability to set an instance for each JVM being polled and then display a set of graph's for each JVM.  To make this work you will have to define a prefix using the "InstancePrefix" setting in each "Connection" block defined in your GenericJMX plugin configuration block.
Please reference the collectd wiki page for more information: https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:GenericJMX

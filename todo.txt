===UI===

- add css framework
	DONE - I'm going with pure css because I'm tired of Bootstrap
	  and I want to learn something else

- trim js for ui down (don't need keydown support for menus)

===ANGULAR===

- create Angular app for searching and filtering on nodes
	DONE - onload XHR to get a list of nodes and load that into $scope.nodes
	DONE - as the user types in search, filter nodes with ng-repeat

  - changing servers allows you to point to prod or non-prod graphite
    for the list of nodes

	- onsubmit XHR for the node details
		- might need a node detail template (partial) here
		- as the user types a metric, filter with ng-repeat
			- metric in metrics
			- might have to add a custom data- attribute
  
  DONE - each node in the nodes list should be an <a> to the detail view
	- need to link to URLs for graphs

  - create partials for the nodelist view and for the node detail view
            
DONE - need some kind of test network access to graphite to pull real
  or more sample JSON objects for further testing
